# Advent of Code 2022

See: https://adventofcode.com/2022

All code is written under some form of time constraint, so quality may vary :)

## Usage 
Every day is a separate folder with (at least) four files:
- `README.md`; The puzzle itself. This puzzle is a copy of the text found at https://adventofcode.com/2022.
- `input.txt`; The puzzle input
- `example.txt`; The example input as given in the puzzle explanation
- `Program.cs`; The code for the puzzle.

To solve the puzzle compile via `dotnet restore` and run via `dotnet run --project Day{xx}`. Commands should be run from the root folder of this year (the folder that contains the `.sln` file).

## Requirements
- .NET 6
- C# 11
