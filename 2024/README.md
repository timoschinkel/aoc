# Advent of Code 2024

See: https://adventofcode.com/2024

All code is written under some form of time constraint, so quality may vary :)

## Usage
This year's Advent of Code is written using PHP 8.2.

Every day is a separate folder with (at least) two files:
- `example.txt`; The example input as given in the puzzle explanation
- `index.php`; The code for the puzzle.

To solve the puzzle run via `php {folder}/index.php`, for example `php 01_historian_hysteria/index.php`. By default, the code uses the `example.txt` from the same folder as puzzle input. Alternative input can be designated via the extra parameter, the puzzle input is also searched in the same folder, for example `php 01_historian_hysteria/index.php input`.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.2
