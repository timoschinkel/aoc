# Advent of Code 2023

See: https://adventofcode.com/2023

All code is written under some form of time constraint, so quality may vary :)

## Usage
Make sure that you have run `npm install` before running the code.

Every day is a separate folder with (at least) two files:
- `example.txt`; The example input as given in the puzzle explanation
- `index.ts`; The code for the puzzle.

To solve the puzzle transpile via `npm run tsc` and run via `node {folder}/index.js`, for example `node 01_trebuchet/index.js`.

## Requirements
- Node 20

There's a `.nvmrc` file, using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is an easy way to ensure you have the correct version of Node installed.
