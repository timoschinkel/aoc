# Advent of Code 2015

See: https://adventofcode.com/2015

All code is written under some form of time constraint, so quality may vary :)

## Usage 
Every day is a separate folder with (at least) two files:
- `example.txt`; The example input as given in the puzzle explanation
- `index.php`; The code for the puzzle.

To solve the puzzle run `node index.js` in the designated folder.

## Requirements
- Node version 18 or higher, a [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) file is present.
