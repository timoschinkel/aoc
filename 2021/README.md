# Advent of Code 2021

See: https://adventofcode.com/2021

All code is written under some form of time constraint, so quality may vary :)

## Usage 
Every day is a separate folder with (at least) four files:
- `README.md`; The puzzle itself. This puzzle is a copy of the text found at https://adventofcode.com/2021.
- `input.txt`; The puzzle input
- `example.txt`; The example input as given in the puzzle explanation
- `index.php`; The code for the puzzle.

To solve the puzzle run `php index.php` in the designated folder.

## Requirements
- PHP version 7.4 or higher
